This upgrade (v1.3.2) includes:

1. Fix to subscription cancellation url (throwing an error 'missing required parameters for route')
2. Fix to success message showing the HTML tags instead of an actual button to /my-account
3. Only show approved companies in /browse-category/{category-name} - it was previously showing pending approval
4. Only show/count ratings averages & stars on reviews that are approved
5. On some phones in browse category page, the stars were going to a 2nd-line - not anymore
